# Battery Metric Prediction

The dataset produced consists of a battery duty profile tailored for an electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, employing a cell typical for such applications.

The dataset encompasses 22 cells, comprising a total of 21,392 charge and discharge cycles.

We used the data provided to model of key battery metrics such as Remaining Useful Life, State of Health, and State of Charge.
